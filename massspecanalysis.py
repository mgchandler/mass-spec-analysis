def diff(time, values, num=5, return_residual=False):
    """ 
    Determines the differential of `values` with respect to `time`. To smooth
    out noise, this is done as a fitting over a subset of `num` points.
    Makes use of the example in the documentation of np.linalg.lstsq to do it.
    Note from documentation of lstsq, residuals are sum of squared residuals,
    or variance of residuals. Typically want to use std = âˆšvariance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : pd.Series
        Time series of shape (N,) containing either numeric values or 
        dt.datetime objects, the times at which `values` were captured.
    values : pd.DataFrame
        Values of shape (N, m), measurements obtained for which the time
        differential will be computed. Zeroth dimension should be N large (same
        size as `time`) and may contain multiple data sets in the first axis.
    num : int, optional
        The number of consecutive points which will be used to regress the
        slope at each time. The function iterates through each column of the
        data taking `num` points, finding the slope of each set and returns
        this value. The default is 5.
    return_residual : bool, optional
        Whether to also return the residual values, might be used for
        evaluating confidence in regression at each point. The default is
        False.
    
    Returns
    -------
    time : pd.Series
        Reduced time series at which the calculated slope is found.
        Mathematically this should be the mean of the `num` values used at
        each point, however it seems more useful to return the closest time in
        the input data to this average.
    dVdt : np.ndarray
        Slopes found from regressing `values` of length equal to the reduced
        `time` Series and m columns.
    res : np.ndarray, optional
        Residuals output directly from each call to np.linalg.lstsq(), the sum
        of squares of the residuals from the fit. This will not be returned if
        `return_residual` is False.

def stable_cycles(time, values, start_offset=10, end_offset=5, slope=.001):

    each point: it is assumed that the largest slope will occur at the start
    and at the end, and the sample will be stable at every point in between.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : pd.Series
        Time series of shape (N,) containing the times at which `values` were

    values : pd.Series or pd.DataFrame

    num : int, optional
        The number of consecutive points which will be used to regress the
        slope at each time, passed through to diff().
    slope : TYPE, optional
        The prominence used to locate peaks, passed through to find_peaks().
        Peaks found in dVdt will be larger than this number. Note that only
        the first and last peak are used: this only needs to be large enough to
        ignore blips in the 11B gas signal. The default is .001, will need
        tailoring based on blips.

def blank_signal(time, values, num=5, factor=3):
    """ 
    Finds the mean of the blank gas signal. Values are first filtered to remove
    outliers from 3std from the mean to remove blips in the output signal. The
    mean is then calculated over each column of `values` for which the slope is
    zero (i.e. determine where in each column of `values` the confidence
